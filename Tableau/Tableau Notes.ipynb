    "## Commonly Used Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "`SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `STDEV`, `ABS`, `CEILING`(ROUNDING TO NEAREST INTEGER), `FLOOR` (ROUNDING DOWN TO NEAREST INTEGER), `ROUND` \n",

    "## Exporting To PDF or PP\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to file => Export as PDF or Powerpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "## Storyboarding\n",
    "Click the story icon on the bottom task bar. We can then slide and organize a storyboard instead of making a PP. \n",

    "## Creating Calculated Field\n",
    "\n",
    "Original data may not have the data we want. Use calculated field to arrive at the data we want. \n",
    "\n",
    "Say that we want price * quantity and they are separate measures. Go to analysis and then scroll down to create calculated field. Type `[field_name]` `mathematical operator` `[field_name]`. We can rename this new calculated field by double clicking the name. We can edit the fields by clicking the down arrow next to the field and click edit. To delete a field, click field down arrow and click delete. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating Calculated Field on A Shelf\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a calculation without going to an external dialogue box. \n",
    "We can double click an empty field in columns or rows and then enter the equation we require for the calculated field. If we want it to become a normal calculated field, we can drag it to the measures and rename it then. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding a Table Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a table first of all. \n",
    "Change how the data is calculated and displayed by the table. Click the pill holding the values and click \"quick table calculation\" to change the calculations seen in the table. \n",
    "\n",
    "Click \"add table calculation\" to get a dialogue box to have a more comprehensive table calculation menu. \"Down\" versus \"across\" is just columns versus row calcualtions. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Level of detail expressions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifies the level of detail for which we want the calculation to occur. Say for example, we want to see the total sales differenced on the average sales, so now we need to conduct a calculation for two levels. \n",
    "\n",
    "To create LOD: \n",
    "- Double click an empty pill (usually rows) \n",
    "- For example, we would do [Order Total] - AVG[Order Total] \n",
    "- This would not work because we did not specify the orders of detail. \n",
    "- Therefore we need to do this: `[Order Total] - {AVG([Order Total])}`\n",
    "- Why doesn't that work? This is because we need to get it right the first time and redo it before making an error. \n",
    "- We can drag this pill to the measures to create a new field\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create calculations in dialog boxes. \n",

    "## Calculating measures of central tendancy. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can look at the marks card and if we wanted to view averages as well, we can click its pill and change measure to average. If we wanted to get the order total and the average on one chart, just drag from the data pane. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Counting Occurences \n",
    "\n",
    "Use calculated field, Analysis Table => Create Calculated Field\n",
    "\n",

    "## Display the Summary Card\n",
    "\n",
    "Provides summary statistics. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Calculate Percentages within a table. \n",
    "\n",
    "GO to Analysis menu => Percentage of to create percentages in the table. We can organize this across rows or across columns. \n",

    "## Forecast Future Values\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to analytics tab => Under Model, click Forecast\n",
    "\n",
    "Forecaast can be greyed out if ur date is formatted in the wrong way. You need to go to the date pill, go to custom date, and if it is selected to \"exact date\" you need to change it to another date. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Sort based on field's values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Click sort in the task bar above. To sort in other ways, we can click in the pills and sort according to the way we want to sort. We can sort by a field that is not displayed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nested Sorts: Use nested sort in the sort option. We then can sort according to the nested sort. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Create a selection filter \n",

    "Instead of using exact, just change the selection filter. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Create Condition Filter\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted to limit the values or apply conditions on a pill/field, we would go to the pill of concern, click filter, use condition tab, and then select `by field` and then apply to relevant conditions. Click load to load the min/max values. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Create Top Filter\n",
    "If we want to compare the top X values of a field, we would go to the filter dialogue box and then go to the top tab. We then select by field and enter criteria. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Filter data using parameters\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Go to parameter panel and then right click and show parameter control. It will be a slider to change the number of values we'd like to see. \n",
    "\n",
    "First create parameter by right clicking measure => Write down filter values by clicking \"allowable values\" => and then right click and show parameter control (sets up filter) => Create calculated field => Drag calculated field to measure => Use the code: \n",

    "# GROUPS\n",
    "\n",
    "## Define a group\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we would like to group two rows together. We would click the two observations, use the super tool box that appears, and then click group members. It will group the string using & in between the two field names.\n",
