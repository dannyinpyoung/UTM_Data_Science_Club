    "### String Methods - Joining Strings\n",

    "```\n",
    "'\\n'.join(smooth_fifth_verse_lines)\n",

    "### Special notes about Boolean Expressions and Strings: \n",
    "\n",
    "Note the following problem: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Create a function called x_length_words that takes a string named sentence and an integer named x as parameters. This function should return True if every word in sentence has a length greater than or equal to x.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A key note is that we require a function that delimits the sentence into a list and iterates through the list, which will return false if len(word) > x. One way to think about it is that we can use a counter to count the number of times that True or False are returned. If counter != len(words), return True, else False. Potentially works but, the smarter way is this: \n",
    "\n",
    "``\n",
    "def x_length_words(sentence, x):\n",
    "  words = sentence.split(\" \")\n",
    "  for word in words:\n",
    "    if len(word) < x:\n",
    "      return False\n",
    "  return True\n",
    "``\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this smarter? Because the for loop iterates over `words` and if any of the elements in the list fails the if statement, it then passes to be true, at which point the whole function returns true. The only way for this function to return false is if every single element is false. This is very similar to an 'or' statement in a more implicit way. For each iteration in `words`, the function passes the if statement. The for loop part is always true, unless every pass through the if statement is false. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Every Other Letter Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Create a function named every_other_letter that takes a string named word as a parameter. The function should return a string containing every other letter in word.\n",

    "Use `type()` to find what type a variable is. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Class\n",
    "\n",
    "Is a template for a data type. It describes the kinds of information that class will hold and how a programmer will interact with that data. \n",
    "\n",
    "__CAPITALIZE FIRST LETTERS OF CLASSES BY BEST PRACTICE__\n",
    "\n",
    "To define a class:\n",
    "\n",
    "`class CoolClass:\n",
    "    pass`\n",
    "\n",
    "Need to write pass to avoid Indentation error. This is called making an _empty class_.\n",

    "# Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Class instance = Object\n",
    "\n",
    "The pattern of defining classes and creating objects to represent the responsibilities of a program is called OOP.\n",
    " \n",
    "Instantiation takes a class and turns it into an object. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type function does the opposite, when called it returns the class of the object. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `type()` provides the class if we use an instance in the argument (since an instance is what turned a class into an object).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Class Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want the same data to be available to every instance of the class, we use class variables. This is a variable that is the same for every instance of the class. \n",
    "\n",
    "Access all object's class variables with `object.variable`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Musician:\n",
    "  title = \"Rockstar\"\n",
    " \n",
    "drummer = Musician()\n",
    "print(drummer.title)\n",
    "# prints \"Rockstar\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Above we defined the class Musician, then instantiated drummer to be an object of type Musician. We then printed out the drummer’s .title attribute, which is a class variable that we defined as the string “Rockstar”.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods are functions that are defined as part of a class. The first argument in a method is always the object that is calling the method. Convention recommends that we name this first argument self. Methods always have at least this one argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to define methods: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "  dog_time_dilation = 7\n",
    " \n",
    "  def time_explanation(self):\n",
    "    print(\"Dogs experience {} years for every 1 human year.\".format(self.dog_time_dilation))\n",
    " \n",
    "pipi_pitbull = Dog()\n",
    "pipi_pitbull.time_explanation()\n",
    "# Prints \"Dogs experience 7 years for every 1 human year.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Above we created a Dog class with a time_explanation method that takes one argument, self, which refers to the object calling the function. We created a Dog named pipi_pitbull and called the .time_explanation() method on our new object for Pipi.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice we didn’t pass any arguments when we called .time_explanation(), but were able to refer to self in the function body. When you call a method it automatically passes the object calling the method as the first argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a method to take `self` and return a string, refer to: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Rules:\n",
    "  def washing_brushes(self):\n",
    "    return \"Point bristles towards the basin while washing your brushes.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constructors\n",
    "\n",
    "Also called dunder methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "First dunder method: `__init__()`: Used to initialize newly created object. Call it to instantiate it. \n",
    "\n",
    "EG: \n",
    "\n",
    "``` \n",
    "class Shouter:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        print(\"HELLO?!\")\n",
    "shout1 = Shouter()\n",
    "shout2 = Shouter()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Everytime we create an instance of shouter (The class), we print out a shout. \n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, blueprint and then everytime we make run through the blueprint and execute it (create an instance), we get the result of our plan which may have a method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can add more parameters to init: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Shouter:\n",
    "  def __init__(self, phrase):\n",
    "    # make sure phrase is a string\n",
    "    if type(phrase) == str:\n",
    " \n",
    "      # then shout it out\n",
    "      print(phrase.upper())\n",
    " \n",
    "shout1 = Shouter(\"shout\")\n",
    "# prints \"SHOUT\"\n",
    " \n",
    "shout2 = Shouter(\"shout\")\n",
    "# prints \"SHOUT\"\n",
    " \n",
    "shout3 = Shouter(\"let it all out\")\n",
    "# prints \"LET IT ALL OUT\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instance Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Data type specific to the instance that it is assigned to. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data held by an object is referred to as an instance variable. Instance variables aren’t shared by all instances of a class — they are variables that are specific to the object they are attached to.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Attribute Functions\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "`getattr(object, attribute, default)`: Same, except a defualt value given. \n",
    "\n",
    "returns `True` if an object has a given attribute and `False` otherwise. If we want the attribute of a value then use `getattr()`. Third argument of `getattr()` will provide a default value. \n",

    "`self.object` refers to the object and not the class being called.\n",
